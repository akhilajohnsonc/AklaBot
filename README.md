## How It Works

AklaBot is designed to bring a smile to your face through coding quotes. At specific intervals, the bot tweets out random coding quotes sourced from a predefined `.txt` file. The magic happens through the synergy of Spring Boot's scheduling and the Twitter4J API.

## Let the Laughter Begin! üòÇ

Follow [@aklabot](https://twitter.com/aklabot) on Twitter to enjoy a daily dose of coding humor and inspiration.

## Getting Started

To run your own instance of AklaBot, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilajohnsonc/AklaBot.git
cd AklaBot
```

### 2. Set Up Twitter4J

AklaBot uses Twitter4J to interact with Twitter's API. Here's how to set it up:

1. Visit [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and create a new application to obtain your API keys and access tokens.
2. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and replace the following placeholders with your Twitter API credentials:
   
   ```properties
   twitter4j.oauth.consumerKey=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
   twitter4j.oauth.consumerSecret=YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
   twitter4j.oauth.accessToken=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   twitter4j.oauth.accessTokenSecret=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
   ```

### 3. Customize Quotes

Add your own coding quotes to `src/main/resources/tweets.txt`. Each quote should be on a new line.

### 4. Build and Run

Build and run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

AklaBot will now start tweeting coding quotes at specified intervals.
